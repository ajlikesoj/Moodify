# Product Brief:

## 🌐 Overview

We are developing an AI-powered music genre and song recommender that suggests songs based on user-input keywords. This product aims to enhance the music discovery experience for users, particularly targeting music enthusiasts and casual listeners who want personalized recommendations tailored to their specific tastes and moods. Users should be able to input a mood or activity, and the system will generate playlists for the requested length. Additionally, users will have the option to add songs to their library or existing playlists.

## 🔍 Background and Context:

- **Problem:** _Many users need help discovering new music that resonates with their preferences and emotions, often resulting in frustration or disinterest in exploring new genres. As a result, many listeners tend to play the same songs on repeat, limiting their musical exposure and preventing them from discovering new favorites that could better align with their evolving tastes and moods._
- **Challenge:** _Users frequently face an overwhelming amount of music options but lack an intuitive system that provides personalized recommendations based on their input keywords_
- **Hypothesis:** _The challenge arises from existing music platforms' inability to accurately analyze and interpret user keywords and preferences. Many rely on generic algorithms that prioritize popularity over personalization, leading to recommendations that often miss the mark. As a result, users struggle to receive tailored suggestions that resonate with their specific moods or activities, hindering their music discovery experience._
- **Opportunity Sizing:** _This product presents a significant opportunity to tap into the growing demand for personalized music experiences, potentially increasing user engagement and satisfaction on music platforms._

## 🏆 Success Criteria:
